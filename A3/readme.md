## 3A Analyse use case
- Goal: Goal of the tool / workflow in one sentence. i.e. to support the user to calculate the total total cost of the project.

The tool should give the user the possibility to fast and easy investigate the quality of daylight in an earlier stage of modelling.

- Model Use (Bim Uses): Please refer initially to the Mapping BIM uses, use cases and processes section in this document.

Please see: [BPMN - Group 23 - Old](https://github.com/Enzuesta/41934-Advanced-BIM-Group23/blob/main/BPMN%20-%20Daylight.bpmn)

## 3B Propose (a design) for a tool / workflow
- Process: model the process diagram from your use case in BPMN.io please remember to save the .bpmn file and you can save a .svg file that you can insert into your report.
- Description of the process of your tool / workflow.

## 3C Information exchange
- Information Exchange: Fill out the excel template with the information for your planned tool / workflow. For this you will need access to the excel, and the Dikon document to help you specify the LOD (LOR,LOG,LOI) for each element you need for you tool / workflow. This can get confusing - don’t worry we can help.
- IFC: Describe the IFC entities and properties for each of the elements you identified in your information exchange. Describe the data that you need to:
- - Find in the IFC
- - Find in an external sources i.e. BR18
- - Based on assumptions (useful when we don't have the 'real' data that we need for our tool)

## 3D Value what is the potential improvement to offer by this tool
This is the common question when developing tools and processes as an intrapreneur in a company. You should consider the business and societal value of this tool – does it save time to the company, does it make employees happier / more productive? Could it reduce material use in society?
- Describe the business value (How does it create value for your business / employer)
- Describe the societal value (How does it make the world better)

## 3E Delivery
In this assignment we will focus on the input data that you need for your final tool / workflow.
- Your tool/workflow: Description of how your tool / workflow would solve the use case
- Delivery: Description of how you would make the tool / workflow - what steps would you go through?
